## What is it?

Whis is web frontend for Owl Unit service me and my friend was developing some time ago.

Due to some issues between us back then I decided to continue on myself and later stopped working on that project.
I found another job and there wes not enough time to continue. Later I tried to rewrite this in Lift Framework, but again, my main job full time job left no time for side projects and even even for weekends sometimes.

## What now?

Project should refactored from scratch, because I no longer think that Lift Framework worth another try.

There is commit history that may be useful some time to me.

Web layout is still good and can be found in [another repository](https://github.com/Otann/owlunit-design)
